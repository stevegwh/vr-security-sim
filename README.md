## Overview
This project was created to teach new security guards the basics of a patrol and to give instructors the ability to assess their knowledge and progress. The simulation was created using Unity3D and the SteamVR SDK.

### Features

- Individual user profiles and statistics.
- Task management system in which users must complete multiple tasks to complete an object.
- In-game voice recording.
- Instructors can record trainee interaction with simulation as a video file and review later.
- Statistics saved as CSV file for instructors to review later.
- Tutorial system with Text-to-Speech voice.
- Inventory system in which users can add and remove virtual objects from the world around them.


I did not create any of the assets present in the demonstration.

(NOTE: due to nature of the research project I am unable to share the source code.)
